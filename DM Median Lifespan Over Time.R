#### DM median lifespan over time
##
## Author: Hannah Koenker
## Created: October 26, 2022
## Data: estimated median survival in serviceable condition ("lifespan") of ITNs from durability monitoring studies
##        gathered from study reports (pmi.gov), from durabilitymonitoring.org, published literature.
##        List of studies is not exhaustive as durabilitymonitoring.org does not track any DM funded through Global Fund.
##        Not all study reports/publications report the outcome of interest; not all completed activities have public reports.
## Notes: some ongoing durability monitoring sites/brands are listed but don't have lifespan estimates yet
## GPS: GPS points in the excel file are copy/pasted from Google Maps near the study site. 
##      They are indicative only and do not represent any GPS points from study households.
